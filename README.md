# Free Speech to Text using Python

I am trying to publish it online somewhere [I haven't published it anywhere]

You can clone this repository and run it locally now!

## Installation
- You will need Python to run
  
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Create a virtual environment

   ```bash
   cd <The directory where you placed this repository>
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment
   - Windows:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   - MacOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install all libraries using pip inside the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Go to your browser and type in:

   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

   **Note**: If you re-activate the virtual environment, reload or use another browser if you have trouble accessing the localhost.
